Frequencer
==========

Horrible name, right? Best I could think up at the moment - subject to change.

Overview
--------

This (right now) is a very simple audio sequencer. A drum machine, if you like.
It's horribly inefficient, the interface isn't even really an interface and
there's very little actual use for it right now. There is, however, massive
potential for fun with this code.

Stay tuned for a better readme!
